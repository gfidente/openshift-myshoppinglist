h1. My Shopping List

h2. Introduction

This is a demo app for mobiles written using "Flask":http://flask.pocoo.org/ and "jQuery Mobile":http://jquerymobile.com. The backend storage is "MongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org.

The app allows you to check and edit some shopping lists from your mobile phone! So if your fellow file it from home, you'll have it at your fingers later, when at the mall!

It has been deployed on "OpenShift":http://openshift.redhat.com which offers MongoDB instances for free, as well as support for any Python WSGI app. Flask is installed using virtualenv.

h2. Deployment

You can fork and publish the app on OpenShift with few easy steps. Fork the repo first, this should give you access on a copy of the repo at your account:

pre. https://github.com/$USERNAME/openshift-myshoppinglist.git

Now create the application on OpenShift:

pre. $ rhc-create-app -a myshoppinglist -n -t python-2.6

add the mongodb cartridge:

pre. $ rhc-ctl-app -a myshoppinglist -e add-mongodb-2.0

add the remote github repo to the existing one with a command like:

pre. $ cd myshoppinglist
 $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/$USERNAME/openshift-myshoppinglist.git

and then pull in your local repo the changes:

pre. $ git pull -X theirs upstream master
$ git push

that's it! the database connectivity is guaranteed by the following environment variables, defined on the OpenShift servers:

pre. dbhost = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_NOSQL_DB_HOST']
dbport = int(os.environ['OPENSHIFT_NOSQL_DB_PORT'])
dbuser = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_NOSQL_DB_USERNAME']
dbpass = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_NOSQL_DB_PASSWORD']

if you choose to give the app a different name, don't forget to reflect the changes in the 'application' file where, by default, the database opened is called 'myshoppinglist'.

Enjoy!
