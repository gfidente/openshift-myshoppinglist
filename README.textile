h2. My Shopping List

This is a demo app for mobiles written using "Flask":http://flask.pocoo.org/ and "jQuery Mobile":http://jquerymobile.com. The backend storage is "MongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org.

The app allows you to check and edit some shopping lists from your mobile phone! So if your fellow file it from home, you'll have it at your fingers later, when at the mall!

It has been deployed on "OpenShift":http://openshift.redhat.com which offers MongoDB instances for free, as well as support for any Python WSGI app. Flask is installed using virtualenv.

Enjoy!
